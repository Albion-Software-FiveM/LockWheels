# LockWheel
 LockWheels is a simple FiveM script that locks the position of your vehicle's wheels when you exit. It ensures the tires remain in their current orientation, creating a realistic parked look instead of resetting to a default straight position. Perfect for adding immersion and enhancing realism in roleplay scenarios.
